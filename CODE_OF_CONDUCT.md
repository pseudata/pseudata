# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as community members, contributors, maintainers, and leaders pledge to make
participation in our community a harassment-free, accessible, and positive
experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible
disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
neurodivergence, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, sexual identity
and orientation, or any other personal characteristic or background.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, safe, inclusive, and healthy community, and we are committed to promoting
a culture of equity and mutual respect.

## Encouraged Behaviors

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy, patience, and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Respecting people's pronouns and identity

## Restricted Behaviors

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within
our community:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment, intimidation, or threats
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
* Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations
* Violence or threats of violence, whether physical or verbal
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Reporting an Issue

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
conduct@pseudata.dev.

All reports will be handled with discretion. If you believe anyone is in
physical danger, please notify appropriate law enforcement first. If you are
unsure what law enforcement agency is appropriate, please include this in your
report and we will attempt to notify them.

In your report, please include:

* Your contact information
* Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved
* If there are additional witnesses, please include them as well
* Your account of what occurred
* If there is a publicly available record (e.g., a mailing list archive or a
  public IRC logger), please include a link

## Addressing and Repairing Harm

If you are found to have violated this Code of Conduct, the community leaders
will take action to address the violation and ensure that it does not happen
again. This may include:

### Initial Assessment

Community leaders will review the reported behavior and determine its severity.
The response will be proportionate to the violation, and may include one or more
of the following actions:

### 1. Acknowledgment and Correction

**Community Impact**: Minor violations, such as unintentional use of
inappropriate language or behavior.

**Response**: A private, written request from community leaders asking the
person to acknowledge the harm caused and requesting that they correct their
behavior. The person may be asked to apologize publicly or privately.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions that create toxicity in the community.

**Response**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction
with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those
enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes
avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like
social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Response**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Response**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.

### Accountability and Restorative Justice

When possible, we encourage a restorative justice approach that focuses on
repairing harm and rebuilding trust. Depending on the situation, this may
involve facilitated conversations, mediation, or other processes designed to
help all parties understand the impact of the behavior and work toward healing.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including but not
limited to:

* Online forums, mailing lists, and chat platforms
* Issue trackers and code review systems
* Social media interactions when representing the project
* In-person events, conferences, and meetups

This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing
the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include
using an official email address, posting via an official social media account,
or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

Community leaders who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith
may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of
the community's leadership.
